## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
```
1.Applicant Registration & Profile Creation:
Applicants can create profiles with their personal details, resumes, educational qualifications, work experience, and other relevant information.
2.Job Posting & Selection Criteria:
The platform allows the creation of job posts with detailed descriptions, required skills, experience, and qualifications.
3.Automated Skill Assessment:
Online tests and quizzes can be integrated to assess specific skills (technical, soft skills, cognitive abilities).
4.Applicant Evaluation:
Based on the applicant's profile and assessment results, the software evaluates candidates by scoring them against predefined criteria.
5.Shortlisting Mechanism:
Based on the evaluation, the system can automatically shortlist candidates by matching their scores with the job requirements.
6.Interview Simulation:
The software can simulate different types of interviews (structured, unstructured, technical, behavioral).
7.Real-time Analytics & Feedback:
Dashboards for recruiters to track the entire hiring process, such as the number of applicants, application status, and results of skill assessments.
8.Applicant Ranking and Notifications:
After evaluation and shortlisting, the system ranks applicants based on their suitability for the job.
9.Customizable Evaluation Framework:
The evaluation framework (questions, assessments, or criteria) can be customized depending on the role and industry.
10.Reporting & Documentation:
Generate reports on applicant performance, interview results, and selection decisions.
